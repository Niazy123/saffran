      <h1>WHAT IS SAFFRON?</h1>
      <p>
        is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as
        the "saffron crocus". The vivid crimson stigma and styles, called
        threads, are collected and dried for use mainly as a seasoning and
        colouring agent in food. Although some doubts remain on its origin, it
        is believed that saffron originated in Iran. However, Greece and
        Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of
        this plant. The saffron crocus was slowly propagated throughout much of
        Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America,
        and Oceania

        Sffron is a spice that is derived from the Crocus Sativus L. flower,
        also known as the "saffron crocus." What makes this spice so special and
        incredibly valuable is the fact that each saffron crocus only produces
        three small threads. Each one of these threads must be handpicked due to
        its delicate nature. It takes roughly 75,000 flowers to produce just a
        single pound of Saffron. Saffron is a healing spice which is used in top
        restaurants around the world, by experimental cooks, and also those who
        enjoy it saffron for its medicinal health benefits.

      <h1>HOW TO TEST SAFFRON?</h1>
      <p>
        Saffron threads are trumpet shaped, if they don't look like trumpets
        it's probably not real saffron. Many sellers use safflower or corn silk
        then spray it to look like saffron. Take a pinch of saffron (about 5-7
        threads) and put in a cup of cold water. Pure saffron will slowly
        release a golden hue, whereas fake or adulterated saffron will release
        its yellow color immediately. Let the saffron threads soak in cold water
        for about 10-15 min, do any of the threads turn clear or white? Pure
        saffron will retain its red color for up to 24 hours. Fake saffron will
        lose its color or turn clear within a few minutes, this is an indication
        that the saffron was dyed with chemicals. Some fraudulent sellers will
        create a mixture of pure and adulterated saffron to increase their
        profits.
